Functional Improvements
Real-Time Market Status Check:

Add an automatic market status checker to display whether the market is currently open or closed.
You could include a countdown timer until the market opens/closes, which would be helpful for timing options analysis.
Automatic Data Refresh:

Implement a real-time or scheduled refresh of data for selected tickers at customizable intervals, ensuring that users get up-to-date information without manual reloading.
You could add a toggle for users to enable or disable auto-refresh to save API calls.
Historical Data Analysis for Options:

Incorporate a historical performance analysis of past options with similar parameters (e.g., strike, DTE). This could help users understand potential patterns in premiums, returns, and risk factors.
Volatility and Greeks Calculation:

Add volatility metrics (like implied volatility) and options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) for each contract. This would give a deeper insight into the risks and sensitivities of the options.
Optionally, you could provide a short explanation for each metric to guide users.
Probability of Profit Estimation:

Integrate a probability of profit (POP) calculation based on implied volatility and other factors. This would give users an estimate of the likelihood that an option will expire in the money or out of the money.
Advanced Filtering Options:

Allow users to set filters for more criteria, like specific strike price ranges or implied volatility thresholds.
Users could also filter for options with a particular moneyness level (in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money).
Backtesting Functionality:

Add a simple backtesting feature to simulate how the strategy (CSP or Covered Call) would have performed over historical periods. This would help users gain confidence in the strategy's viability over time.
Portfolio Integration:

Allow users to upload a CSV with their current portfolio, enabling a custom analysis based on their owned stocks and desired strategies.
Alternatively, offer integration with popular brokerage APIs (e.g., TD Ameritrade, Robinhood) for real-time portfolio syncing.
Email or Notification Alerts:

Implement an alert system that sends an email or notification when certain conditions are met, such as when an option meets all user-defined criteria or when a market condition changes.
Profit and Loss (P&L) Visualization:

Add a P&L chart showing potential outcomes for the options. For example, users could view a graph depicting max gain, max loss, and break-even points for each strategy.
UI/UX Improvements
Dashboard Layout for Key Metrics:

Design a dashboard section that summarizes key metrics like average annualized return, highest available return, and market status.
Use cards or boxes to highlight important figures, like total filtered options and overall max return, for quick reference.
Progress Indicator for Data Processing:

Add a loading bar or spinner to show the status of data retrieval and processing. This would give users a sense of the app’s progress, especially when analyzing multiple tickers or contracts.
Data Table Enhancements:

Allow users to sort and filter the data table in-app, rather than just applying predefined filters.
Include expandable rows or pop-ups in the table to show additional option details without cluttering the main display.
Interactive Charts and Visualizations:

Add interactive bar or line charts for metrics like DTE vs. return, option volume over time, or strike price vs. return. This would help users spot trends visually.
Use color-coding to highlight higher returns, higher volumes, or riskier options.
Enhanced Data Export Options:

Add options to export filtered data as CSV or Excel files for external analysis.
Additionally, offer a print-friendly version or PDF export, which would be useful for users wanting to review data offline.
Tooltips and Guidance for New Users:

Add tooltips with explanations for key metrics and filters. This would be helpful for users who are newer to options trading.
A quick "how to use" guide or a tutorial mode would help beginners understand the app’s functionalities more easily.
Mobile Optimization:

Improve the mobile layout by creating a responsive design that adjusts elements for smaller screens.
Implement collapsible sections or tabs to keep the mobile experience uncluttered.
Save and Load User Preferences:

Allow users to save their preferred settings (e.g., selected tickers, filter criteria) for future sessions.
Adding a “Save Session” feature would let users quickly load their previous analysis settings without re-entering data.
Comparison Mode:

Add a mode that allows users to compare multiple options side-by-side in a comparison table or chart, highlighting key differences in metrics like total return and annualized return.
You could also let users compare different tickers for the same strategy or see side-by-side results for CSP and Covered Call on the same ticker.
Dark Mode Toggle:

Add a dark mode option, as it’s often preferred by users working late or using the app in low-light environments.
